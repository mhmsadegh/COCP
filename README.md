# COCP
Title: COCP Project
Project Description
<p>COCP is a tool designed to identify disease gene modules through advanced computational analysis. This repository contains the source code and necessary files to identify these modules. In order to run the code successfully, you will need the dataset "Co_Occurrence.npy.</p>


<p>The dataset "Co_Occurrence.npy" is located in the "Data" folder of this repository. However, due to file size limitations on GitHub, the dataset is hosted on Google Drive. You can download the dataset using the following link:</p>

<p> How to Use the Dataset</p>

    Download the Dataset:
        Click on the provided link to access the dataset on Google Drive.
        On the Google Drive page, click on the download icon (arrow pointing downward) located at the top center of the page to download the file to your local machine.

    Integration with the Code:
        After downloading the dataset, place the "Co_Occurrence.npy" file in the "Data" folder of this repository.

    Accessing the Dataset in Your Code:
        In your Python code, you can access the dataset using the following path:

        

    data_path = "Data/Co_Occurrence.npy"
