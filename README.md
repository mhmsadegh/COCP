# COCP
Title: COCP Project
Project Description

COCP is a tool designed to identify disease gene modules through advanced computational analysis. This repository contains the source code and necessary files to identify these modules. In order to run the code successfully, you will need the dataset "Co_Occurrence.npy," which is crucial for understanding the relationships and interactions within the gene network.
Dataset Details

The dataset "Co_Occurrence.npy" is located in the "Data" folder of this repository. However, due to file size limitations on GitHub, the dataset is hosted on Google Drive. You can download the dataset using the following link:
